# Twitter Clone Application (in progress)
A Twitter clone built with React, featuring user registration, post 
creation, and commenting.

- Set up custom project configuration conforming to industry best practices for accessibility and internationalization (webpack, jest, babel, eslint, i18n) 
- Implemented FSD pattern for the best scalability and business orientation.
- Used code splitting and memorization approaches for optimization as well as BundleAnalyzer and ErrorBoundary.
- Implemented UI tests (Storybook + Loki), unit and integrational tests (jest, react-testing-library).
- Implemented the GitHub CI pipeline in the project to automate the testing processes.

Will be:
- E2E tests using Cypress
- RTK query
- and more
